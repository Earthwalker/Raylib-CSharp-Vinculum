# Raylib-CsLo
LowLevel autogen bindings to Raylib 4.0 and convenience wrappers on top.  


- Requires use of `unsafe`
- A focus on performance.  No runtime allocations if at all possible.
- because these are autogen, there won't be any intellisense docs. [read the raylib cheatsheet for docs](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html)


# ðŸš§ðŸš¨ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§ðŸš¨ðŸš§
Currently the bindings work, but because these are bare-bones, autogen bindings, they are not user friendly, even for `unsafe` use.
Right now only about 10 core examples have been ported.

## Release timeline

### `PRE-ALPHA`
- **The current status.**
- You can look around, try out the samples, but I would not recomend using it.  

### `ALPHA`
- A Nuget package will be released at that time.
- Triggered when all the [core examples](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) are ported. This will ensure that a minimal set of convenience wrappers are in place to keep things from getting too miserable.

### `BETA`
- Triggered when the `model` and `shaders` examples are ported. 


### `RELEASE`
- Triggered when all examples are ported.  You can contribute to make this happen.
