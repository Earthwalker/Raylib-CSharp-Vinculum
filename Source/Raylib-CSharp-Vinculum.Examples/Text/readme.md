# `Text` EXAMPLES

Please see the various `*.cs` files inthis folder for complete examples.  However, please note that these examples require the `global using` statements found in the `../Program.cs` file to run properly.   The easiest way to run them is to just comment out the examples you don't want, and run the example project.


Here are thumbnails of the examples included in this folder:
